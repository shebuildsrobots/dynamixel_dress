# Dynamixel Dress
A self-twirling dress using Dynamixel motors.

Materials:
*  2x ROBOTIS 2XL430-W250-T DYNAMIXELS
*  2x ROBOTIS FR11-H101K Frames/Mount Set
*  OpenRB-150 and Arduino IDE
*  12V power source
*  Faux leather belt
*  Waxed leatherworking thread and needle
*  2x 1/4" square dowel rods
*  4x M2x5mm screws and screwdriver
*  2x printed square dowel mounts from the STL file included in this repo

Sew the frames down to the sides of a leather belt. Use an extremely strong threads such as waxed leather thread. Cotton thread, even doubled up, will break from the force of the motors.

Print the dowel mounts from the STL file and cut 1/4" squares to approximately 2 feet long. Use a strong glue to secure the dowel inside the 3D printed mount and let dry overnight.

Before installing the dowels, program your Dynamixel B-sides to point to 0 degrees. Remove from power, then mount the Dynamixels onto the frames in a fully upright position. 

Use M2x5mm screws to secure the dowel mounts to the A side of the Dynamixel motors.

Power up the board with your 12V source and tweak the motor motion as you'd like using code.

TODO: Add details about necessary board modification to support 12V direct.
